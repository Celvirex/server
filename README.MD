# Minecraft Server Creation on Codespace 24h 
I'm just hosting a mc server in GitHub Codespace because I can't afford shit. Reminder it has to restart every 4 hours because of the idle time.
# IP for server: MCSoManyfaces.jsx.pm:63734
- NOTE SERVER RESTARTS EVER 4 hours  and it takes a while to start 
- No rules or admins.

I will create a tutorial in this repo soon
