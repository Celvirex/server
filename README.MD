# Minecraft Server Creation on Codespace 24H
I'm just hosting a mc server in GitHub Codespace because I can't afford shit
# IP for server: MCSoManyfaces.jsx.pm:63734
- NOTE SERVER RESTARTS EVER 4 hours  and it takes a while to start 
- No rules or admins.

I will create a tutorial in this repo soon
